# My Journey into DevOps as an AIML Student

As an AIML student at UPES, my journey into the world of DevOps began with a bootcamp conducted by INTESEAM professors. Coming from an artificial intelligence and machine learning background, the concepts of development operations (DevOps) seemed foreign at first. However, I soon realized the importance of these tools and practices, especially as they enable seamless collaboration between development and IT operations. The goal was to understand how to automate and streamline processes like code integration, deployment, and managing infrastructure—skills critical for both data scientists and developers.

Throughout the bootcamp, I covered a wide array of topics, starting with the fundamentals of Linux, Bash, and Docker. These form the foundation of managing server environments and application containers. As I progressed, I delved deeper into advanced topics like CI/CD pipelines, setting up reverse proxies using Nginx, deploying Python-based applications using Flask, and managing multi-container applications using Docker Compose.

This bootcamp not only provided me with practical DevOps skills but also gave me an understanding of how to apply these tools in real-world scenarios, including scaling AI and ML models in production environments. By the end of the bootcamp, I had a solid grasp of how to manage the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to deployment, using DevOps practices.

## Step 1: Introduction to Docker, Linux, and Bash

My journey began with learning the fundamental building blocks: Linux, Bash, and Docker. These are essential tools for any DevOps professional, as they provide the foundation for managing servers, automating tasks, and running applications in containers.

### 1. Linux

Linux, being the operating system that powers the majority of servers worldwide, was the logical starting point. I began by familiarizing myself with essential Linux commands, which allowed me to navigate the filesystem, manage files, and control permissions. Linux also provides an ideal environment for running servers and applications, making it crucial to understand basic system management.

Key Linux commands I learned include:
- **`cd`**: Change directory.
- **`mkdir`**: Make a new directory.
- **`ls`**: List the files and directories in the current directory.
- **`sudo`**: Execute a command with superuser privileges.

An important concept I grasped was the power of package managers like `apt` in Ubuntu, which I used to install and manage software packages. For example:
- **`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`**: This command updates the package lists for upgrades and installs the newest versions of all packages installed on the system.
- **`sudo apt install docker.io`**: This command installs Docker, a critical tool for containerization, on my machine.

With this understanding, I gained control over the Linux environment, enabling me to install software and manage resources efficiently.

### 2. Bash

Bash is a Unix shell and command language that allows users to write scripts for automating tasks. For a DevOps practitioner, Bash scripting is invaluable because it automates repetitive tasks, such as setting up servers, configuring environments, and managing applications.

One of the first tasks I learned to automate using Bash was building Docker containers. A simple Bash script can execute a sequence of commands to streamline processes that would otherwise require manual intervention.

For example, I wrote scripts to update systems, install Docker, and start containers in one go. This kind of automation is a game-changer in DevOps because it reduces human error and saves time.

### 3. Docker

Docker was one of the most exciting concepts I learned in the bootcamp. Docker is a platform that allows you to package applications into containers—lightweight, standalone units that include everything needed to run the application, such as the code, dependencies, and system libraries.

Docker solves the “it works on my machine” problem by ensuring that applications run the same way in every environment. This consistency is crucial when moving applications from development to production.

Key Docker concepts include:
- **Containers**: Isolated instances that run applications. Containers share the host OS kernel but run independently.
- **Images**: Blueprints for containers, defined by a Dockerfile. An image contains everything needed to run an application, including the code and dependencies.

By learning Docker, I could package applications into containers, simplifying deployment across different environments.

## Step 2: CI/CD, Networks, Nginx, and Flask Integration

After mastering the basics, I moved on to integrating and automating the development pipeline using CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). This was a pivotal step in my DevOps learning because it allowed me to see how software is continuously built, tested, and deployed automatically, ensuring fast and reliable software delivery.

### 1. CI/CD Pipelines

A CI/CD pipeline automates the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository and deploying the latest version of an application. Each time I make changes to the code, the CI/CD pipeline automatically tests the code to ensure it works as expected and then deploys it to production if the tests pass.

During the bootcamp, I experimented with popular CI/CD tools like:
- **GitHub Actions**: A CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub that automates tasks such as testing, building, and deploying applications.
- **Jenkins**: An open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy applications.

For example, I set up a simple pipeline that would run unit tests on my Flask application whenever I pushed changes to the GitHub repository. This ensured that I didn't introduce any bugs into the application.

### 2. Nginx

Nginx is a powerful web server that can also act as a reverse proxy. In DevOps, Nginx is commonly used to route incoming web traffic to backend services like Flask applications. It can also handle static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

One of the tasks I performed was configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy for my Flask application. This setup is essential for production environments because it allows Nginx to handle client requests and forward them to the Flask backend.

In addition, Nginx improves the scalability and security of web applications by managing large volumes of traffic and providing features like load balancing and SSL termination.

### 3. Flask

Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used to build web applications quickly. During the bootcamp, I used Flask to create the backend logic for my Netflix clone project. Flask’s simplicity makes it easy to integrate with Docker and Nginx for deployment.

One of the challenges I faced was packaging the Flask application into a Docker container and configuring Nginx to serve it. Once I got the configuration right, I could scale the Flask app and handle more simultaneous users.

### 4. Setting Up SSH Keys for GitHub

To make pushing code to GitHub more secure and efficient, I learned to set up SSH keys. SSH keys enable secure, passwordless connections between my local machine and GitHub, allowing me to push and pull code without manually entering my credentials every time.

To generate SSH keys, I used the following commands:
- **`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`**: This generates a new SSH key pair.
- **`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`**: This adds the private key to my SSH agent, allowing it to manage the keys automatically.

This setup is essential in any DevOps workflow because it streamlines the process of managing code repositories securely.

## Final Project: Cloning My Own Netflix Application

The capstone project of my DevOps journey was an ambitious undertaking: cloning a Netflix-like web application. This project allowed me to put all my newfound skills into practice, combining AI/ML principles with DevOps tools and practices.

### Project Overview

The objective was to create a web application similar to Netflix that allows users to browse, search, and watch movies and TV shows. The application would have features like user authentication, a dynamic front end, and a robust back end. This project involved using Flask for the backend, Nginx as the web server, and Docker for containerization.

#### Challenges Faced

1. **Learning Curve**: Transitioning from AI/ML concepts to web development and deployment was initially confusing. Understanding how different components interact and the best practices for structuring the application took time.
2. **Integration**: Integrating the front end and back end required extensive testing to ensure that all APIs were functioning correctly and that data flowed seamlessly.
3. **Deployment**: Deploying the application to the cloud and ensuring it could handle traffic while maintaining performance posed additional challenges. Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy and managing SSL certificates were crucial for security and accessibility.

#### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React for building user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Flask to create RESTful APIs.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for managing user data and content information.
- **Containerization**: Docker to package the application.
- **Web Server**: Nginx to serve the application and manage traffic.

### Steps to Clone the Netflix Application

1. **Setting Up the Environment**

   I started by setting up a local development environment using Linux and Docker. Installing necessary tools like Node.js for React and Python for Flask was my first task.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm python3 python3-pip docker.io
   ```

   I also ensured Docker was running and ready for creating containers.

2. **Creating the Backend with Flask**

   The first step in building my Netflix clone was to create the backend using Flask. I defined the API endpoints for user authentication, content retrieval, and streaming.

   Here’s a simple Flask API setup:

   ```python
  



 from flask import Flask, jsonify
   from flask_cors import CORS

   app = Flask(__name__)
   CORS(app)

   @app.route('/api/movies', methods=['GET'])
   def get_movies():
       # Sample data
       movies = [
           {'id': 1, 'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010},
           {'id': 2, 'title': 'The Matrix', 'year': 1999}
       ]
       return jsonify(movies)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

   I also created a `requirements.txt` file for my Python dependencies, including Flask and Flask-CORS for handling cross-origin requests.

3. **Developing the Frontend with React**

   Next, I created the frontend using React. I structured the application using components that interacted with the Flask API to display movies.

   Here’s a basic example of a component fetching movies from the API:

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   const Movies = () => {
       const [movies, setMovies] = useState([]);

       useEffect(() => {
           fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/movies')
               .then(response => response.json())
               .then(data => setMovies(data));
       }, []);

       return (
           <div>
               <h1>Movies</h1>
               <ul>
                   {movies.map(movie => (
                       <li key={movie.id}>{movie.title} ({movie.year})</li>
                   ))}
               </ul>
           </div>
       );
   };

   export default Movies;
   ```

4. **Containerizing the Application with Docker**

   With both the front end and back end developed, I created a Dockerfile for each component to containerize the application.

   **Backend Dockerfile:**

   ```dockerfile
   # Use Python as base image
   FROM python:3.8-slim

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY requirements.txt .
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

   COPY . .

   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

   **Frontend Dockerfile:**

   ```dockerfile
   # Use Node.js as base image
   FROM node:14

   WORKDIR /app

   COPY package.json ./
   RUN npm install

   COPY . .

   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

   I built the Docker images and ran the containers, ensuring both parts of the application could communicate properly.

5. **Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**

   To manage traffic and serve the application, I set up Nginx. I created an Nginx configuration file to route incoming requests to the appropriate container.

   Example Nginx configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://frontend:3000; # React frontend
       }

       location /api {
           proxy_pass http://backend:5000; # Flask backend
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Using Docker Compose for Multi-Container Deployment**

   I defined all services in a `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify managing the multiple containers.

   ```yaml
   version: '3'
   services:
     frontend:
       build:
         context: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
     backend:
       build:
         context: ./backend
       ports:
         - "5000:5000"
     nginx:
       image: nginx:latest
       volumes:
         - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
       ports:
         - "80:80"
   ```

   With this setup, I could start all services with a single command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

7. **Deploying to the Cloud**

   Finally, I pushed the Docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and deployed them to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). This step allowed my application to be accessible online.
