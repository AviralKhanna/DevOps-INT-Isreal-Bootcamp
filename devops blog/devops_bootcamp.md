# Step 1: Introduction to Docker, Linux, and Bash
At the beginning of your DevOps journey, it’s essential to grasp the basics of Docker, Linux, and Bash, especially if you come from a non-development background. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each:

1. **Linux**: As a foundational operating system for most servers, Linux commands allow you to manage resources like files, services, and networking. Familiarizing yourself with commands like `cd` (change directory), `mkdir` (make a directory), `ls` (list files), and `sudo` (superuser privileges) is key to managing environments effectively. For instance:
   - **`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`**: Updates the package lists and upgrades installed packages.
   - **`sudo apt install docker.io`**: Installs Docker on your machine.
   
2. **Bash**: Bash is a Unix shell used for scripting tasks. It automates repetitive jobs such as building Docker containers or setting up servers. Learning Bash can greatly simplify your operations in DevOps.

3. **Docker**: Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with all dependencies in a consistent environment. This eliminates the “works on my machine” problem by ensuring that the app runs the same way on any device, including your local machine, a server, or in the cloud. Key concepts include:
   - **Containers**: Lightweight, isolated instances that run your code.
   - **Images**: Blueprints for containers, defined by a **Dockerfile**.

As a non-developer, once you understand how containers work, you can easily deploy applications without worrying about complex environment setups.

# Step 2: CI/CD, Networks, Nginx, and Flask Integration
Once the basics were established, you delved deeper into automating the deployment process and integrating networks, servers, and applications.

1. **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**:
   - **CI/CD pipelines** automate the testing, integration, and deployment of code. Each time you make a change to your application, the CI/CD pipeline runs automated tests to ensure the new code doesn’t break the app. After passing tests, the code is deployed to production.
   - Tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and CircleCI allow you to implement these processes efficiently.

2. **Nginx**:
   - Nginx is a web server that acts as a reverse proxy, handling requests and serving them to your Flask application. Nginx is commonly used to serve static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and route incoming requests to backend services like Flask.
   - Example setup:
     - Configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy for Flask is essential when scaling web applications.

3. **Flask**:
   - Flask is a lightweight Python web framework for building simple web applications. During the bootcamp, you used Flask to create the backend logic for your Netflix clone. Flask applications are easy to integrate into Docker and Nginx for deployment.

4. **Setting Up SSH Keys for GitHub**:
   - To avoid frequently entering passwords and streamline code pushes to GitHub, you set up **SSH keys**. SSH (Secure Shell) keys enable secure, passwordless connections to GitHub, allowing you to push and pull code securely.
   - To set this up:
     - **`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"`**: This command generates a new SSH key.
     - **`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`**: Adds the private key to your SSH agent.

With these concepts, you moved from a basic understanding of Docker and Linux to setting up automated, secure workflows that make deploying applications easier.

# Step 3: Dockerizing the Netflix Clone
In this step, you worked on Dockerizing your Netflix clone application. Dockerizing an application means wrapping it in a Docker container so it can run consistently on any machine.

1. **Creating a Dockerfile**:
   - A Dockerfile is essentially a script of commands that tells Docker how to build your container. For your Netflix clone, the Dockerfile would define the base image (e.g., Python), install dependencies (Flask, etc.), and run the application.
   - **Basic Dockerfile Structure**:
     ```Dockerfile
     # Use Python as base image
     FROM python:3.8-slim

     # Set working directory in the container
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
     COPY requirements.txt .
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

     # Copy the rest of your application
     COPY . .

     # Command to run Flask app
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```
   - **Building the Docker Image**:
     - Use the following command to build the Docker image:  
       **`docker build -t netflix-clone .`**

2. **Running the Docker Container**:
   - Once your image is built, you can run it in a container with the command:
     **`docker run -p 5000:5000 netflix-clone`**
   - This will make your application accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

# Step 4: Deploying Docker Containers
Finally, you learned how to deploy your Docker containers to the cloud.

1. **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**:
   - ECR is AWS’s container image registry. It stores your Docker images and allows you to deploy them to services like AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS).
   - To push an image to ECR, you first authenticate using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <ECR-URI>
     ```
   - Then, tag your Docker image and push it to the repository:
     ```bash
     docker tag netflix-clone:latest <ECR-URI>/netflix-clone:latest
     docker push <ECR-URI>/netflix-clone:latest
     ```

2. **Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications**:
   - In more complex setups, you may need multiple containers (e.g., one for the Flask app, another for a database). Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.
   - **docker-compose.yml**:
     ```yaml
     version: '3'
     services:
       web:
         image: netflix-clone
         ports:
           - "5000:5000"
       database:
         image: postgres
         environment:
           POSTGRES_USER: user
           POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
     ```

3. **Starting the Application with Docker Compose**:
   - After defining services in the `docker-compose.yml` file, start them with:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```

For instance:
   - **`sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade`**: This command updates the package lists for upgrades of all packages that need upgrading and installs the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.
   - **`sudo apt install docker.io`**: This command installs Docker on my machine, enabling me to run containerized applications.

2. **Bash**: Bash is a Unix shell that I use for scripting tasks. It allows me to automate repetitive jobs such as building Docker containers or setting up servers. Learning Bash significantly simplifies my operations in DevOps, as it enables me to write scripts that can execute multiple commands in sequence, improving efficiency and reducing the potential for human error.

3. **Docker**: Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with all their dependencies in a consistent environment. This eliminates the “works on my machine” problem by ensuring that the app runs the same way on any device, whether it’s my local machine, a server, or in the cloud. Key concepts include:
   - **Containers**: These are lightweight, isolated instances that run my code. They share the host OS kernel but operate independently, making them more efficient than traditional virtual machines.
   - **Images**: These are the blueprints for containers, defined by a **Dockerfile**. An image contains everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and environment variables.

As a non-developer, once I understood how containers work, I could easily deploy applications without worrying about complex environment setups.

# Step 3: Dockerizing the Netflix Clone

In this step, I focused on Dockerizing my Netflix clone application. Dockerizing an application means wrapping it in a Docker container, ensuring it can run consistently on any machine.

1. **Creating a Dockerfile**:
   - A Dockerfile is essentially a script of commands that instructs Docker on how to build my container. For my Netflix clone, the Dockerfile defines the base image (e.g., Python), installs dependencies (like Flask), and specifies how to run the application.
   - **Basic Dockerfile Structure**:

     ```dockerfile
     # Use Python as base image
     FROM python:3.8-slim

     # Set working directory in the container
     WORKDIR /app

     # Copy requirements.txt and install dependencies
     COPY requirements.txt .
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

     # Copy the rest of your application
     COPY . .

     # Command to run Flask app
     CMD ["python", "app.py"]
     ```

   - **Building the Docker Image**:
     - To build the Docker image, I used the command:  
       **`docker build -t netflix-clone .`**. This command reads the Dockerfile in the current directory (denoted by `.`) and creates an image tagged as `netflix-clone`.

2. **Running the Docker Container**:
   - After building my image, I can run it in a container with the command:
     **`docker run -p 5000:5000 netflix-clone`**. This command maps port 5000 of my host machine to port 5000 of the container, making my application accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
